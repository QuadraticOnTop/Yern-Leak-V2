This pile of shit was made by some people who cannot code and thats why i recommend not reading it but if you wish to you are free to use it or modify it i dont really care about this.

1) Change MongoDB uri in .env
2) Change Bot Token in .env
3) Change copyright if you are gonna skid it
4) do "node ." to run this pile of shit
